<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Late at night sometime in Februari, Kalle Hasselström and Jon Åslund
(that is us, we, the authors) were sitting with a programming
assignment due for demonstration at nine the following morning. It was
assignment number four in our Syntax Analysis course and we were
pretty tired with it. The last assignment, on the other hand, seemed
like much more fun, because you were allowed to do pretty much
whatever you wanted as long as it involved lexical and syntactical
analysis. So instead of finishing the fourth assignment, we started
making up some great ideas for the fifth, the kind you only conceive
of when you really should be asleep.

<P>
A few weeks earlier we had discovered a number of truly fascinating
programming languages, such as
Java2k<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="#foot116"><SUP>1</SUP></A>,
Sorted!<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="#foot117"><SUP>2</SUP></A>,
Brainfuck<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="#foot118"><SUP>3</SUP></A> and
Malbolge<A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="#foot119"><SUP>4</SUP></A>,
and we wanted to make our own. We have no idea why, but that night we
were also thinking about Shakespeare in general, and Shakespearian
insults in particular and three hours later we had come up with this
amazing idea: the Shakespeare Programming Language, SPL.

<P>
This is the documentation of the language and how we made it.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Design Goals</A>
</H1>

<P>
The design goal was to make a language with beautiful source code that
resembled Shakespeare plays. There are no fancy data or control
structures, just basic arithmetic and gotos. You could say we have
combined the expressiveness of BASIC with the user-friendliness of
assembly language.

<P>
The course was about syntactic analysis, not compiler construction.
Thus, we didn't make an SPL compiler, just an SPL to C converter. This
proved to be fairly simple, since SPL can be translated directly to C,
one statement at a time.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Hello World!</A>
</H1>

<P>
Since we don't want to break with ancient tradition, let's begin with
a simple example: a Hello World program. Though it might seem
otherwise, the <I>sole</I> purpose of this program is to print the
string ``Hello World!''. It resides in the file <TT>hello.spl</TT>,
and also in appendix <A HREF="shakespeare.html#sec:hello"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/latex2html-2K.1beta/crossref.gif"></A>. If you want to run it yourself,
consult section <A HREF="shakespeare.html#sec:myprogram"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/latex2html-2K.1beta/crossref.gif"></A>.

<P>
Let's dissect the program and see how it works.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">
Title</A>
</H2>

<P>
The first line of every SPL program is the title. Or actually,
everything up until the first period is the title, whether it's one
line, three lines, or half a line. You're generally free to insert
space and newlines wherever you want in the code, but we <I>urge</I>
you to <I>please</I> indent tastefully.

<P>
The title serves only aesthetic purposes. From the parser's point of
view, it's a comment.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">
Dramatis Person&#230;</A>
</H2>

<P>
The next few lines are a list of all characters in the play. Think of
them as variables, capable of holding a signed integer value. You must
declare every character you intend to use, or the program won't
compile.

<P>
A declaration consists of a name, followed by a description of the
character (which is ignored by the parser). You can't pick just any
name, however; you must use a real Shakespeare character name, such as
Romeo, Juliet, or the Ghost (Hamlet's deceased father).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000">
Acts and Scenes</A>
</H2>

<P>
The purpose of acts and scenes is to divide the play into smaller
parts. A play consists of one or more acts, each act consists of one
or more scenes, and each scene consists of lines (where the characters
say something) and enter and exit statements, which cause characters
to get on and off the stage.

<P>
Acts and scenes are numbered with roman numerals. They begin with the
word ``Act'' or ``Scene'', then the number, and then a description of
what happens in that act or scene. Just as with the title and the
character descriptions, these descriptions are ignored by the parser.

<P>
Besides being beautiful and descriptive, acts and scenes also serve as
labels, which can be jumped to using goto statements. There are no
gotos in the Hello World program, however, so we'll talk about that
later.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00044000000000000000">
Enter, Exit and Exeunt</A>
</H2>

<P>
To be able to speak their lines, characters must be on stage. The
character they address as ``you'' (or ``thou'' or any other
second-person pronoun) must also be on stage. But if there is yet
another character on stage, it's not clear which one is intended. This
is frowned upon by the parser.

<P>
Enter Enter and Exit<A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="#foot35"><SUP>5</SUP></A>. These directives cause characters to get on
and off stage. ``Enter'' is followed by a list of one or more
characters. ``Exit'' is followed by exactly one character. The plural
of Exit is ``Exeunt'', which is followed by a list of at least two
characters - or none, in which case everyone leaves.

<P>
An Enter directive given to a character already on stage, or the other
way around, will cause a runtime error.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00045000000000000000">
Lines</A>
</H2>

<P>
A line consists of the name of a character, a colon, and one or more
sentences. In the Hello World program, only two kinds of sentences are
used: output, which causes output to the screen, and statements, which
cause the second person to assume a certain value.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00045100000000000000">
Constants</A>
</H3>

<P>
First, we'll explain how constants (that is, constant numbers, such as
17 and 4711) are expressed.

<P>
Any noun is a constant with the value 1 or <IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$-1$">, depending on whether
it's nice or not. For example, ``flower'' has the value 1 because
flowers are nice, but ``pig'' has the value <IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$-1$"> because pigs are
dirty (which doesn't prevent most people from eating them). Neutral
nouns, such as ``tree'', count as 1 as well.

<P>
By prefixing a noun with an adjective, you multiply it by two. Another
adjective, and it is multiplied by two again, and so on. That way, you
can easily construct any power of two or its negation. From there,
it's easy to construct arbitrary integers using basic arithmetic, such
as ``the sum of <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$X$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$Y$">'', where <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$X$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$Y$"> are themselves
arbitrary integers.

<P>
For example, ``the difference between the square of the difference
between my little pony and your big hairy hound and the cube of your
sorry little codpiece''. Substituting the simple constants with
numbers, we get ``the difference between the square of the difference
between 2 and 4 and the cube of -4''. Now, since the difference
between 2 and 4 is <IMG
 WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$2 - 4 = -2$">, and the cube of <IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$-4$"> is <IMG
 WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$(-4)^3 =
-64$">, this is equal to ``the difference between the square of <IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$-2$"> and
<IMG
 WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$-64$">''. The square of <IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$-2$"> is <IMG
 WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$(-2)^2 = 4$">, and the difference of 4
and <IMG
 WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$-64$"> is 60. Thus, ``the difference between the square of the
difference between my little pony and your big hairy hound and the
cube of your sorry little codpiece'' means 60.

<P>
As you see, this way of writing constants gives you much more poetic
freedom than in other programming languages.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00045200000000000000">
Assignment of Values</A>
</H3>

<P>
Now, how do we use those numbers? Well, just have a look at the two
statements ``You lying stupid fatherless big smelly half-witted
coward!'' and ``You are as stupid as the difference between a handsome
rich brave hero and thyself!''

<P>
The first one is simple: A second person pronoun, followed by a
number. The effect of this statement is to assign the value of that
number (in this case, <IMG
 WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$-64$">) to the character being spoken to. Think
``<IMG
 WIDTH="74" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img10.gif"
 ALT="$X=-64$">''.

<P>
The second one is slightly more complicated. For starters, what is the
value of ``thyself''? That's not a noun, that's a reflexive pronoun.
It's value is the current value of the character being spoken to. So
the number in the second statement is <IMG
 WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.gif"
 ALT="$8 - X$">, where <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$X$"> is the value
of the character being spoken to. And just as you might expect from
your experience with English, the second statement is just another
assignment. Think ``<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$X$"> = 8 - <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$X$">''. Being ``as bas as'', ``as good
as'', or as [any adjective] as something else, means being
<I>equal</I> to that something.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00045300000000000000">
Output</A>
</H3>

<P>
The other kind of sentence used in the Hello World program is output.
There are two different output sentences, ``Open your heart'' and
``Speak your mind''. The first causes the character being spoken to to
output her or his value in numerical form, and the other, being more
literal, outputs the corresponding letter, digit, or other character,
according to the character set being used by your computer.

<P>
In this program, we use only the second form. The whole program is a
long sequence of constructing a number, writing the corresponding
character, constructing the next number, writing the corresponding
character, and so on.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
A Slightly Less Trivial Example</A>
</H1>

<P>
Now for a slightly less trivial example: computing prime numbers. In
the file <TT>primes.spl</TT>, and in appendix <A HREF="shakespeare.html#sec:primes"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/latex2html-2K.1beta/crossref.gif"></A>, is a
program that asks the user for a number, then prints all primes less
than or equal to that number.

<P>
There are three things in this program that we havn't seen before:
input, gotos, and conditional statements.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000">
Input</A>
</H2>

<P>
The input statements work just like the output statements, except that
they read instead of write. To read a number, as in this program, use
the sentence ``Listen to your heart.'' To read a character, use ``Open
your mind.'' The value will be assigned to the character being spoken
to, as usual.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000">
Gotos</A>
</H2>

<P>
A sentence like ``Let us return to scene III'' means simply ``goto
scene III''. Instead of ``let us'', you may use ``we shall'' or ``we
must'', and instead of ``return to'', you may use ``proceed to''. If
you specify a scene, it refers to that scene in the current act. There
is no way to refer to a specific scene in another act - you have to
settle for jumping to the act itself.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00053000000000000000">
Conditional statements</A>
</H2>

<P>
Conditional statements come in two easy steps, as illustrated by the
following code fragment:

<P>
<PRE>
Juliet:
 Am I better than you?

Hamlet:
 If so, let us proceed to scene III.
</PRE>

<P>
First, someone voices a question. This is some sort of comparison,
which will be either true or false. But more on that later.

<P>
Then comes, at some later point, a conditional statement. This is
constructed by putting either ``if so'' (or ``if not'') and a comma in
front of any sentence - that sentence is only executed if the
answer to the last question was yes (or no).

<P>
This is pretty much like how you would do conditional jumps and things
in many assembly languages.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00053100000000000000">
Comparisons</A>
</H3>

<P>
Comparisons are constructed the way you would expect: ``is <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$X$"> as good
as <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$Y$">'' tests for equality, with <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$X$"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$Y$"> being arbitrary values.
You may substitute ``good'' with any adjective. ``is <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$X$"> better than
<IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$Y$">'' tests if <IMG
 WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="$X &gt; Y$">. This works for any positive comparative. If
you want to test whether <IMG
 WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.gif"
 ALT="$X &lt; Y$">, use a negative comparative, such as
``worse''.

<P>
If you want to invert the test, say ``not as good as'' or ``not better
than''.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
A Slightly Less Trivial Example</A>
</H1>

<P>
One might almost say that the language described this far ought to be
able to do anything that can be done with other programming languages,
albeit more flowery, were it not for the fact that the storage
capacity is severely limited. There are only so many Shakespeare
characters (some one hundred of them are recognized by the parser),
and each of them can only store an integer of finite size. Thus the
storage capacity is finite, and it follows that SPL can only handle
problems of finite size.

<P>
Realizing this, we added stacks to the language. We'll describe them
in just a minute; but first, have a look at how they can be used. The
program in the file <TT>reverse.spl</TT> - which can also be found in
appendix <A HREF="shakespeare.html#sec:reverse"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="http://www.nada.kth.se/icons/latex2html-2K.1beta/crossref.gif"></A> - reads any number of characters, and then
spits them out again in reverse order.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00061000000000000000">
Stacks</A>
</H2>

<P>
Characters in the Shakespeare Programming Language are not
simple-minded, limited to remember just one number. Like normal
people, they can actually remember several. In accord with modern,
highly experimental psychological research, this is implemented with
stacks.

<P>
Every character can push integers onto their memory, and pop them out
again at a later time. Pushing is done like this: 

<P>
<PRE>
Lady Macbeth:
 Remember me.
</PRE>

<P>
This of course causes whoever Lady Macbeth is speaking to to push the
value of Lady Macbeth onto his or her stack. Popping is even simpler:

<P>
<PRE>
Lady Macbeth:
 Recall your imminent death!
</PRE>

<P>
The only significant word here is ``recall''; everything that follows
is artistic fluff. This piece of code causes whoever Lady Macbeth is
speaking to to pop an integer from his or her stack and assume that
value for him- or herself.

<P>
Trying to pop when the stack is empty is a sure sign that the author
has not yet perfected her storytelling skills, and will severly
disappoint the runtime system.

How To Compile Your SPL Program
</H1>

<P>
There is no SPL compiler. We do encourage you to write one, but at
present there is only a translator, which translates SPL to C. The C
file is then compiled and linked the usual way.

the object file must be linked with the library <TT>libspl.a</TT>, which
contains such stuff as dreams are made on.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00080000000000000000">
How We Compiled the SPL Translator</A>
</H1>

<P>
The SPL to C translator was built using
Flex<A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="#foot120"><SUP>6</SUP></A> and
Bison<A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="#foot121"><SUP>7</SUP></A>. Flex creates
a lexical analyzer, which eats source code and spits out tokens. Bison
creates a parser that builds a parse tree out of these tokens,
whereupon it is converted to C code.

<P>
We did not write the lexical analyzer specification by hand, since it
contains a large number of very simple, very similar statements.
Instead, we wrote a small program to do it for us.

<P>
The lexical analyzer and the parser are linked into the same
executable, along with some string manipulation utilities that the
parser uses a lot.

<P>
Last, we also build a library containing all the functions used in the
C files generated by the translator.

                    Scene I: The insulting of Romeo.

[Enter Hamlet and Romeo]

Hamlet:
 You lying stupid fatherless big smelly half-witted coward!
 You are as stupid as the difference between a handsome rich brave
 hero and thyself! Speak your mind!

 You are as brave as the sum of your fat little stuffed misused dusty
 old rotten codpiece and a beautiful fair warm peaceful sunny summer's
 day. You are as healthy as the difference between the sum of the
 sweetest reddest rose and my father and yourself! Speak your mind!

 You are as cowardly as the sum of yourself and the difference
 between a big mighty proud kingdom and a horse. Speak your mind.

 Speak your mind!

[Exit Romeo]

                    Scene II: The praising of Juliet.

[Enter Juliet]

Hamlet:
 Thou art as sweet as the sum of the sum of Romeo and his horse and his
 black cat! Speak thy mind!

[Exit Juliet]

                    Scene III: The praising of Ophelia.

[Enter Ophelia]

Hamlet:
 Thou art as lovely as the product of a large rural town and my amazing
 bottomless embroidered purse. Speak thy mind!

 Thou art as loving as the product of the bluest clearest sweetest sky
 and the sum of a squirrel and a white horse. Thou art as beautiful as
 the difference between Juliet and thyself. Speak thy mind!

[Exeunt Ophelia and Hamlet]


                    Act II: Behind Hamlet's back.

                    Scene I: Romeo and Juliet's conversation.

[Enter Romeo and Juliet]

Romeo:
 Speak your mind. You are as worried as the sum of yourself and the
 difference between my small smooth hamster and my nose. Speak your
 mind!

Juliet:
 Speak YOUR mind! You are as bad as Hamlet! You are as small as the
 difference between the square of the difference between my little pony
 and your big hairy hound and the cube of your sorry little
 codpiece. Speak your mind!

[Exit Romeo]

                    Scene II: Juliet and Ophelia's conversation.

[Enter Ophelia]

Juliet:
 Thou art as good as the quotient between Romeo and the sum of a small
 furry animal and a leech. Speak your mind!

Ophelia:
 Thou art as disgusting as the quotient between Romeo and twice the
 difference between a mistletoe and an oozing infected blister! Speak
 your mind!
